## ⏱️ Priority Handling Instructions

- **P0 (Most Critical Events):**
  - Drop all tasks and prioritize immediately.
  - Notify stakeholders without delay.

- **P1 (Critical Events):**
  - Notify within 3 hours.
  - Prioritize speed with accuracy.

- **P2 (High Priority Events):**
  - Notify within 3 hours.
  - Requires prompt action, though not as critical as P1.

- **P3 (Regular Events):**
  - Follow regular workflow.
  - No urgency but ensure thoroughness.

- **P4 (Low Priority Events):**
  - Handle after higher priority events.
  - Can be addressed when workload allows.

## 🔺 Escalation Rule

If multiple events occur simultaneously:
**Always prioritize in this order: `P0 > P1 > P2 > P3 > P4`**
